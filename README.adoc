= doc-build

This is a quick little ruby environment for building
https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] documents and syncing them with websites.
It is currently used to create slides, books, and exercise documents that are
posted to https://web.njit.edu/~rxt1077/.

It is typically used as a submodule within a class git repository. Dockerfile
and docker-compose.yml will need to be symlinked in the root of the repository.
